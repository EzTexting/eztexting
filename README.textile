h1. eztexting

This is a gem built to make the eztexting api's as easy to use as possible. They allow for use of all of what the API offers in a 
very easy and clear fashion.

h2. Dependencies

This gem relies on HTTParty for making its requests. That is the only runtime dependency. The testing uses rspec and the documentation
is written to be viewed with YARD.

h2. API Calls Available
These are the following calls available and their corresponding classes to use them

* SMS (Eztexting::Sms)
* Credit Purchase and Balance Check (Eztexting::Credits)
* Keyword Check and Configuration (Eztexting::Keyword)
* Carrier Lookups (Eztexting::Lookup)
* Voice Broadcast (Eztexting::Broadcast)
  

h2. Basic Example

<notextile><pre>
  
# Setup the connection for making requests.
Eztexting.connect!('username','password')
# => "credentials cached"  
  
# Make a hash with the required keys of subject, message and phonenumber
# and then send out the SMS. Its that simple. 3 lines, 2 if you condense the creation of the Hash into the Method call
# The response will be an array , the first element will be the response mapped from the code to the literal that the Eztexting
# documentation lists out. The second element will be the raw value. In some cases this bit is important , in the credit balance
# check this would be the number of credits. 
msg = {:subject => "testing out how awesome eztexting is", :phonenumber => "5165551234", :message => "Wow this is so simple and easy to use"}
Eztexting::Sms.single(msg)
# => ["Message Sent",1]

# Check Your Credit Count
Eztexting::Credits.balance
# => ["The amount of plan and additional credits available", 54353]
